      * _Abstract:_ When do people care about relative gains in trade? Much of the international relations (IR) scholarship—and much of the political rhetoric on trade—would lead us to expect support for a trade policy that benefits ourselves more than it benefits others. Yet, a large interdisciplinary literature also suggests the prevalence and importance of other-regarding preferences, rendering the conventional wisdom in IR contestable. We investigate whether and how relative gains influence trade preferences through an original survey experiment in the midst of the China–U.S. trade war. We find that relative gains shape trade opinion in a win-win scenario: people want to gain more than their foreign trade partner if both sides are gaining from trade. However, the relative-gains considerations are offset in a win-lose scenario where the other side is losing out. Relative-gains considerations causally affect opinion on trade, but not in a "beggar-thy-neighbor"—or even a "beggar-thy-rival"—situation. These findings contribute to our understanding of the role of relative gains in IR, and provide the first experimental evidence that relative-gains considerations can be offset by other-regarding preferences in international trade.

      * _Abstract:_ A number of studies have established a strong link between anti-immigration and Eurosceptic attitudes. But does this relationship necessarily imply that more immigration would increase public Euroscepticism in member states of the European Union? I evaluate this question by analyzing immigration data and Eurobarometer survey data over the period 2009–2017. The analysis shows no evidence that individual levels of Euroscepticism increase with actual levels of immigration. This result suggests that a strong link between anti-immigration and Eurosceptic attitudes does not necessarily translate into a strong link between immigration levels and public Euroscepticism. Public Euroscepticism can still be low even if immigration levels are high.

  * **Yeung, Eddy S. F.** &nbsp; "Overestimation of the Level of Democracy among Citizens in Nondemocracies." _Revise and Resubmit_.
      * _Abstract:_ Overestimation of the level of democracy is prevalent among citizens in nondemocracies. Despite such prevalence, no research to date has systematically documented this phenomenon and examined its determinants. Yet given the renewed interest in the role of legitimacy in authoritarian survival, studying whether and why this phenomenon arises is important to our understanding of authoritarian resilience. I argue that, even in the absence of democratic institutions in nondemocracies, autocrats exercise media control in order to boost their democratic legitimacy. This façade of democracy, in turn, benefits their survival. Combining media freedom data with individual survey response data that include 27,000 observations from nineteen nondemocracies, I find that overestimation of the level of democracy is more prevalent in countries with stronger media control. This finding underscores the importance of media in autocracies, and sheds light on media control as a strategy for authoritarian survival.

  * **Yeung, Eddy S. F.** &nbsp; "Can Conservatives Be Persuaded? Framing Effects on Support for Universal Basic Income in the US." [[pre-analysis plan](https://osf.io/bcuqe/)]
      * _Abstract:_ Universal basic income (UBI) has been proposed as a policy response to technological advances and structural inequality, but recent data show that most conservatives in Europe and the US are strongly opposed to it. Can framing UBI as a policy that conforms to their ideological predispositions overcome such opposition? Exploiting the compatibility of UBI with core conservative ideals including individualism and laissez-faire government, I design an original survey experiment that randomly exposes treated respondents to one of two frames: (1) an _equalizing–opportunity_ frame which emphasizes that UBI creates a level playing field and promotes self-responsibility, or (2) a _limiting–government_ frame which highlights UBI as a policy that limits government and reduces bureaucracy. I find that American conservatives—identified by using 10 policy statements—remained strongly opposed to UBI even after they were presented with such frames. Analyses of open-ended responses, which show that _how_ conservatives explained their opposition to UBI remained unchanged regardless of framing, reinforce this conclusion. Conservatives' opposition to UBI remained rigid, even after the key components of UBI that fit the conservative ideology were accentuated. The results thus shed important light on the political feasibility of framing UBI.
