  * "[Does Immigration Boost Public Euroscepticism in European Union Member States?](https://doi.org/10.1177/14651165211030428)" _European Union Politics_, forthcoming.
      * **Abstract:** A number of studies have established a strong link between anti-immigration and Eurosceptic attitudes. But does this relationship necessarily imply that more immigration would increase public Euroscepticism in member states of the European Union? I evaluate this question by analyzing immigration data and Eurobarometer survey data over the period 2009–2017. The analysis shows no evidence that individual levels of Euroscepticism increase with actual levels of immigration. This result suggests that a strong link between anti-immigration and Eurosceptic attitudes does not necessarily translate into a strong link between immigration levels and public Euroscepticism. Public Euroscepticism can still be low even if immigration levels are high.

  * "Relative Gains in the Shadow of a Trade War," with [Kai Quek](https://ppaweb.hku.hk/f/quek). _Revise and Resubmit_.
      * **Abstract:** When do people care about relative gains in trade? Much of the international relations (IR) scholarship—and much of the political rhetoric on trade—would lead us to expect support for a trade policy that benefits ourselves more than it benefits others. Yet, a large interdisciplinary literature also suggests the prevalence and importance of other-regarding preferences, rendering the conventional wisdom in IR contestable. We investigate whether and how relative gains influence trade preferences through an original survey experiment in the midst of the China–U.S. trade war. We find that relative gains shape trade opinion in a win-win scenario: people want to gain more than their foreign trade partner if both sides are gaining from trade. However, the relative-gains considerations are offset in a win-lose scenario where the other side is losing out. Relative-gains considerations causally affect opinion on trade, but not in a "beggar-thy-neighbor"—or even a "beggar-thy-rival"—situation. These findings contribute to our understanding of the role of relative gains in IR, and provide the first experimental evidence that relative-gains considerations can be offset by other-regarding social preferences in international trade.
  * "Overestimation of the Level of Democracy among Citizens in Nondemocracies." _Under Review_.
      * **Abstract:** Overestimation of the level of democracy is prevalent among citizens in nondemocracies. Despite such prevalence, no research to date has systematically documented this phenomenon and examined its determinants. Yet given the renewed interest in the role of legitimacy in authoritarian survival, studying whether and why this phenomenon arises is important to our understanding of authoritarian resilience. I argue that, even in the absence of democratic institutions in nondemocracies, autocrats exercise media control in order to boost their democratic legitimacy. This façade of democracy, in turn, benefits their survival. Combining media freedom data with individual survey response data that include 27,000 observations from nineteen nondemocracies, I find that overestimation of the level of democracy is more prevalent in countries with stronger media control. This finding underscores the importance of media in autocracies, and sheds light on media control as a strategy for authoritarian survival.
