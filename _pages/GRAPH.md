I am a committee member of the [Global Research Association of Politics in Hong Kong](https://graph-hk.github.io/web) (GRAPH), an international research network for academic researchers studying Hong Kong. We provide a platform to connect those who are interested in **Hong Kong politics**. We also organize online talks and academic conferences.

To receive information about our upcoming talks, please subscribe to our [mailing list](https://forms.gle/L85raaDrjX3suitM9) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GRAPHhk)!

See more information about the background and goals of GRAPH [here](https://graph-hk.github.io/web/about).
