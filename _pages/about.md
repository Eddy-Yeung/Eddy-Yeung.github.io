I am a PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), and [Graduate Research Fellow](https://halle.emory.edu/student-opportunities/graduate-fellows.html) at the [Halle Institute for Global Research](https://halle.emory.edu/index.html).

I study public opinion in both autocratic and democratic contexts. My research on _autocracies_, on one hand, explores how autocrats manipulate public opinion by using media control and political rhetoric. My research on _democracies_, on the other, studies how individuals form their policy attitudes such as redistribution and trade preferences. Bridging autocratic and democratic publics, I research how citizens from different countries understand important concepts such as democracy and patriotism, and examine how such bottom-up understandings shape domestic politics.

I hold an MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk/applying/scholarships-bursaries/) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html). I also hold a BEcon in Economics, Politics, and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.scholarships.hku.hk/Scholarships/detail/158) and [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp/).

My research has been published in _Comparative Political Studies_, _European Union Politics_, _International Organization_, and _Political Behavior_.
