I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at Emory University. My primary interests are authoritarian public opinion and comparative political economy, with a secondary interest in international political economy. I hold an M.Phil. in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was Hughes Hall Scholar and Hong Kong Scholar. I also hold a B.Econ. in Economics and Political Science from the University of Hong Kong, where I was John Swire Scholar and Undergraduate Research Fellow. My recent research is forthcoming in <i>European Union Politics</i>.
