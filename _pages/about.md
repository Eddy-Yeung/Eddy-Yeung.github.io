Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Department of Politics & International Relations](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk) and an Associate Member in [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk). In Fall 2026, I will join the [Bush School of Government & Public Service](https://bush.tamu.edu) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu) as Assistant Professor of Political Science.

My [research](https://eddy-yeung.github.io/research) examines how political communication and elite strategy shape **democratic legitimacy under autocracy** and the **psychology of conflict escalation and deescalation**, with a focus on East Asia, the United States, and their interactions. Uniting my body of scholarship is a broader interest in how elites and mass publics influence one another in the political system, both domestic and international.

I completed my PhD in Political Science at Emory University. I also hold an MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html), and a BEcon in Economics, Politics, and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.swire.com/en/community/scholarships.php), [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp), and a first-generation-to-college student.

Growing up in Hong Kong's public housing shaped how I think about social inequality, social justice, and social policy. It also drew me closer to the masses, whose formation of political attitudes is the crux of my research agenda.

My research has appeared in a wide range of journals, including [_Comparative Political Studies_](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/cps), [_Foreign Policy Analysis_](https://academic.oup.com/fpa), [_International Organization_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization), [_Political Behavior_](https://link.springer.com/journal/11109), [_Political Science Research and Methods_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods), [_Science_](https://www.science.org/journal/science), and [_The Journal of Politics_](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/jop/current). I also authored a book, <em>Deescalating a Trade War</em> (with Kai Quek), forthcoming at [Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org/core/publications/elements/international-relations) in its Elements in International Relations series.
