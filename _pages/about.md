I am a PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), and a [Halle Global Fellow](https://halle.emory.edu/student-opportunities/graduate-fellows.html) at the [Halle Institute for Global Research](https://halle.emory.edu/index.html).

I study public opinion in both autocratic and democratic contexts. My research on autocracies focuses on how autocrats manipulate public opinion by using media control and political rhetoric. My research on democracies focuses on how individuals form their views on important socioeconomic issues such as immigration, redistribution, and trade.

I hold an MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk/applying/scholarships-bursaries/) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html). I also hold a BEcon in Economics and Political Science from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.scholarships.hku.hk/Scholarships/detail/158) and [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp/).

My research has been published or is forthcoming in _Comparative Political Studies_, _European Union Politics_, and _International Organization_.
