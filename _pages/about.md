I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at [Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home) and Graduate Research Fellow at the [Halle Institute for Global Research](https://halle.emory.edu/index.html).

My research centers on the interaction between public opinion and political communication across autocracies and democracies. My research on autocracies, on the one hand, explores how autocrats manipulate public opinion and generate democratic legitimacy by using **media control** and **political rhetoric**. My research on democracies, on the other hand, studies how individuals form their attitudes toward domestic and foreign policies such as **social welfare** and **international cooperation**. Bridging autocratic and democratic publics, I research how global citizens understand contested concepts such as **democracy** and **patriotism**, and examine how such bottom-up understandings shape domestic politics in turn.

I hold an MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk/applying/scholarships-bursaries) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html). I also hold a BEcon in Economics, Politics, and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.scholarships.hku.hk/Scholarships/detail/158) and [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp).

My research has been published in _Comparative Political Studies_, _European Union Politics_, _International Organization_, and _Political Behavior_.
