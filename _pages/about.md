I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at [Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home), Graduate Research Fellow at the [Halle Institute for Global Research](https://halle.emory.edu/index.html), and Smith Fellow at the [Institute for Humane Studies](https://www.theihs.org).

I study public opinion on liberal ideals and policies across autocracies and democracies. Specifically, my research on autocracies explores how autocrats manipulate public opinion and generate democratic legitimacy by using _media control_ and _political rhetoric_. My research on democracies, on the other hand, studies how individuals form their attitudes toward liberal policy issues such as _social welfare_ and _international cooperation_. Bridging autocratic and democratic publics, I research how global citizens understand controversial concepts such as _democracy_ and _patriotism_, and examine how such bottom-up understandings shape domestic politics in turn.

I hold an MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk/applying/scholarships-bursaries) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html). I also hold a BEcon in Economics, Politics, and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.scholarships.hku.hk/Scholarships/detail/158) and [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp).

My research has been published in _Comparative Political Studies_, _European Union Politics_, _International Organization_, and _Political Behavior_.
