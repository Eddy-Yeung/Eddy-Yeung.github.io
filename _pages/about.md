I am a PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html).

I study public opinion and authoritarian politics, focusing on how autocrats manipulate public opinion by using strategic political communication. I also study comparative and international political economy, focusing on how individuals form their views on important socioeconomic issues such as immigration, redistribution, and trade.

I hold an MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk/applying/scholarships-bursaries/) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html). I also hold a BEcon in Economics and Political Science from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.scholarships.hku.hk/Scholarships/detail/158) and [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp/).

My research has been published or is forthcoming in _European Union Politics_, _Comparative Political Studies_, and _International Organization_.
