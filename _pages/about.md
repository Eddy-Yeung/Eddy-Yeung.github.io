I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at [Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home). I am also a Princeton Dissertation Scholar at the [Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice](https://bobst.princeton.edu), Graduate Research Fellow at the [Halle Institute for Global Research](https://halle.emory.edu/index.html), and EPOVB Early-Career Fellow at [APSA's Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behavior Section](https://connect.apsanet.org/s32).

I study the interplay between public opinion and political communication across autocracies and democracies, with regional foci on East Asia and the United States. My research on autocracies, on the one hand, explores how autocrats manipulate public opinion and generate democratic legitimacy by using **media control** and **political rhetoric**. My research on democracies, on the other hand, studies how individuals form their attitudes toward domestic and foreign policies such as **social welfare** and **international cooperation**. Bridging autocratic and democratic publics, I research how global citizens understand contested concepts such as **democracy** and **patriotism**, and examine how such bottom-up understandings shape domestic and international politics in turn.

I hold an MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk/applying/scholarships-bursaries) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html). I also hold a BEcon in Economics, Politics, and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.scholarships.hku.hk/Scholarships/detail/158), [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp), and a first-generation-to-college student.

Growing up in Hong Kong's public housing shaped how I think about social inequality, social justice, and social policy. It also drew me closer to the masses, whose formation of political attitudes is the crux of my research agenda.

My research has been published in _Comparative Political Studies_, _European Union Politics_, _International Organization_, and _Political Behavior_. My other work has been conditionally or principally accepted at _Political Science Research and Methods_ and _The Journal of Politics_.
