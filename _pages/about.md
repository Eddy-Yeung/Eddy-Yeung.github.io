I am a PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), and [Graduate Research Fellow](https://halle.emory.edu/student-opportunities/graduate-fellows.html) at the [Halle Institute for Global Research](https://halle.emory.edu/index.html).

I study public opinion on liberal ideals and policies across autocracies and democracies. Specifically, my research on autocracies explores how autocrats manipulate public opinion and generate democratic legitimacy by using media control and political rhetoric. My research on democracies, on the other hand, studies how individuals form their attitudes toward liberal policy issues such as social welfare and international cooperation. Bridging autocratic and democratic publics, I research how global citizens understand controversial concepts such as democracy and patriotism, and examine how such bottom-up understandings shape domestic politics in turn.

I hold an MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk/applying/scholarships-bursaries) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html). I also hold a BEcon in Economics, Politics, and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.scholarships.hku.hk/Scholarships/detail/158) and [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp).

My research has been published in _Comparative Political Studies_, _European Union Politics_, _International Organization_, and _Political Behavior_.
