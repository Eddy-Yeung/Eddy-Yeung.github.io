I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at Emory University.

My primary research interest lies in authoritarian public opinion, focusing on how citizens in nondemocracies form their opinion on the political system. I also study comparative and international political economy, with a specific focus on immigration, international trade, and redistribution preferences.

I hold an M.Phil. in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was Hughes Hall Scholar and Hong Kong Scholar. I also hold a B.Econ. in Economics and Political Science from the University of Hong Kong, where I was John Swire Scholar and Undergraduate Research Fellow.

My recent research is forthcoming in <i>European Union Politics</i>.
