I am a PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), and [Graduate Research Fellow](https://halle.emory.edu/student-opportunities/graduate-fellows.html) at the [Halle Institute for Global Research](https://halle.emory.edu/index.html).

I study public opinion in both autocratic and democratic contexts. My research on autocracies explores how autocrats manipulate public opinion by using media control and political rhetoric. My research on democracies studies how individuals form their attitudes toward important policy issues such as immigration, redistribution, and trade.

I hold an MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk/applying/scholarships-bursaries/) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html). I also hold a BEcon in Economics, Politics, and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.scholarships.hku.hk/Scholarships/detail/158) and [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp/).

My research has been published in _Comparative Political Studies_, _European Union Politics_, _International Organization_, and _Political Behavior_.
