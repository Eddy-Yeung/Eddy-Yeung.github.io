I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at [Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home). I am also Princeton Dissertation Scholar at the [Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice](https://bobst.princeton.edu) and Emerging Scholar at the [Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation](https://www.hfg.org).

I study how political communication, elite strategy, and psychology shape (1) the dynamics of **conflict escalation** and **deescalation** and (2) public opinion on **international cooperation** and **democracy**, with a focus on East Asia, the United States, and their interactions. Broadly, my [research](https://eddy-yeung.github.io/research) lies at the intersection of comparative politics and international relations, focusing on mass-elite interactions in domestic and international politics.

I hold an MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html). I also hold a BEcon in Economics, Politics, and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.swire.com/en/community/scholarships.php), [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp), and a first-generation-to-college student.

Growing up in Hong Kong's public housing shaped how I think about social inequality, social justice, and social policy. It also drew me closer to the masses, whose formation of political attitudes is the crux of my research agenda.

My research has been published or is forthcoming in _Comparative Political Studies_, _International Organization_, _Political Behavior_, _Political Science Research and Methods_, _Science_, _The Journal of Politics_, and other journals.
