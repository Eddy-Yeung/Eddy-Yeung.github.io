I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html).

My primary research interest lies in authoritarian public opinion, focusing on how citizens in nondemocracies form their opinion on the political system. I also study comparative and international political economy, with a specific focus on immigration, international trade, and redistribution preferences.

I hold an M.Phil. in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk/study-with-us/scholarships/) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html). I also hold a B.Econ. in Economics and Political Science from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.scholarships.hku.hk/Scholarships/detail/158) and [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp/).

My recent research is forthcoming in _European Union Politics_.
