Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at [Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home). I am also Princeton Dissertation Scholar at the [Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice](https://bobst.princeton.edu) and Emerging Scholar at the [Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation](https://www.hfg.org). In Fall 2026, I will join the [Bush School of Government & Public Service](https://bush.tamu.edu) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu) as Assistant Professor of Political Science.

My [research](https://eddy-yeung.github.io/research) examines how political communication, elite strategy, and psychology shape (1) the dynamics of conflict escalation and deescalation and (2) public opinion on international cooperation and democracy. Focusing primarily on East Asia and the United States, my scholarship brings both theoretical and empirical insights into the various forms of mass-elite interactions in domestic and international politics.

I hold an MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge, where I was [Hughes Hall Scholar](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk) and [Hong Kong Scholar](https://hkses.edb.gov.hk/en/index.html). I also hold a BEcon in Economics, Politics, and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong, where I was [John Swire Scholar](https://www.swire.com/en/community/scholarships.php), [Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://tl.hku.hk/urfp), and a first-generation-to-college student.

Growing up in Hong Kong's public housing shaped how I think about social inequality, social justice, and social policy. It also drew me closer to the masses, whose formation of political attitudes is the crux of my research agenda.

My research has appeared in a wide range of journals, including [_Comparative Political Studies_](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/cps), [_Foreign Policy Analysis_](https://academic.oup.com/fpa), [_International Organization_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization), [_Political Behavior_](https://link.springer.com/journal/11109), [_Political Science Research and Methods_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods), [_Science_](https://www.science.org/journal/science), and [_The Journal of Politics_](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/jop/current).
